# GameOfLife
I wrote this simulation upon hearing news of professor Conway's passing (RIP prof. Conway!). Currently I randomly initialize the game that allows me to observe interesting patterns that may not have been observed (but also missing lots of other well known patterns). I am hoping to expand it to form more of his well known patterns.
